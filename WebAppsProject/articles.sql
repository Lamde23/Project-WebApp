('/dev: 2024 Item Changes', '2023-11-30', 'item', 'Hello everyone, I\'m Nick \"Riot Endstep\" Frijia here to talk about items. Specifically, I\'ll be covering item power budgets and AP itemization, and then Haiyin \"Riot Rose7ea\" Yang will take over to talk about support items.\r\nItem Power Budgets\r\nWe\'ve discussed Mythic items in a previous dev article, so I\'ll only cover them briefly here. Since mythic items were added to League, we\'ve been unhappy with how items ended up being a larger percentage of the overall power budget than desired and overrode champion kits to an extreme degree. We\'re looking to go back on this to allow the core gameplay of League to revolve around fulfilling champion fantasies. This is important because champions are a richer, more compelling, and more immersive way to deliver gameplay fantasies and experiences than items are. League needs to support players who want to attach to specific characters or gameplay fantasies, rather than systemic ones from items. Champion fantasies can be much richer and more compelling than items due to the much larger degree of difference in theme, playstyle, and feel than items do. League\'s roster offers a diverse set of different champion fantasies, and not every champion is for everyone, so it\'s important to us that we support the existing champion fantasies for anyone who wants to opt into that experience.\r\n\r\nIceborn_Gauntlet.png\r\n\r\nAcross the board, we\'re reducing the power of items to target relatively close to their power level before the mythic system was introduced. Previously, we\'ve limited the systemic creep of non-champion power through things like the 12.10 Durability Update or the 13.20 runes nerfs, but we\'re looking to address one of the primary sources of excessive snowballing through items. Items are the primary way that you translate gold into power, and as items have grown more powerful over time they have made gold worth more than it was in older versions of the game. At the same time, we\'ve also made it easier for you to access more gold by adding things like turret plates and Treasure Hunter. Some systemic adjustments to the values of different objectives and mechanics are fine, but we believe that the current value of gold has been pushed too high, which has led to excessive snowballing through gold leads (primarily from kill gold and tower gold).\r\n\r\nOf course, we understand that you may have some concerns about this — powerful items feel good to buy, and part of the appeal of the mythic system was concentrating power into singular items that could be more satisfying. With these changes, we\'re looking to consolidate item power into simple, satisfying effects rather than having more broad items that do multiple different things simultaneously. For example, we\'re moving Liandry\'s back into being a high-uptime caster item where it is more clearly at its best when the user is dealing damage to their targets over a long period of time. This is in contrast to the new item, Stormsurge, which is the opposite: it\'s designed to synergize with gameplay patterns that concentrate their burst into a narrow window.\r\n\r\nLiandry_s.png\r\nAP Itemization\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Liandry\'s and Stormsurge, AP itemization and mage items, in particular, have been something you\'ve been asking for some time now and is something we\'ve wanted to revisit meaningfully. Overall, mages haven\'t been happy with their items, and recently, the AP system as a whole has been less exciting than other item systems. As such, we identified two key areas we believe will improve the AP system, particularly for mages: locked slots and pattern binding. Note that this update specifically targets mages and, to a lesser extent, AP assassins and is not intended to address AP fighters.\r\n\r\nDeathcap.png\r\nLocked Slots\r\n\r\nYou might be saying, \"Endstep, what are you talking about? What are locked slots?\" When we say \"locked slots,\" it means the slots in a build that are bound to entire classes, e.g., you must buy this item (or buy from this set of items). In the past, this has been things like Trinity Force for light fighters or Infinity Edge for marksmen. Over time, we\'ve generally done one of two things to solve this: either add competitive, alternative items so that even if the slot is \"locked,\" there are some other options for you to choose between, or remove the locked nature by making the class less dependent upon that item\'s output. This time around, we took a hard look at AP champions, and for them, Rabadon\'s Deathcap and Void Staff have been locked slots since the dawn of League. On top of that, mages have also had an additional locked slot for their mana item.\r\n\r\nThe mythic system improved this in a few ways for mages by adding some competition among mana items, which meant that not every mage had to have the same first item. We\'re preserving that structure in the newly demythiced system and intentionally changing these mana item options to be more pattern-bound rather than output-bound (we\'ll dive into these terms in a bit). We also want to try this same strategy for Void Staff, so we\'re introducing Cryptbloom as an alternative percentage penetration option for mages and other AP champions. '),
('/dev: Cat Cults, Rift Mechs, and Baron’s Revamp', '2023-11-28', 'objectives', 'A look behind some of the objective changes we made for Season 2024.\r\n2 days ago\r\nDev\r\nAuthorRiot Phlox\r\n\r\nHi, I\'m Ezra \"Riot Phlox\" Lynn, game designer on objective changes for Season 2024, and I\'m here to tell you a tale about cat cultists, Ornn pillars, mech fights, and a new look for Baron Nashor.\r\n\r\nIt all began in February when we were doing early planning for the 2024 Gameplay Changes. One of our high-level goals was to change League of Legends at a strategic level, specifically in the late game. We knew we wanted some sort of \"strategic differentiation\" at the time—ways to improve and shake up League macro and strategy. We also wanted to create additional differences between lanes, particularly to make top lane more valuable.\r\n\r\nWe started looking at objectives and found that some were feeling a bit stale. The Baron/Dragon dance had been going on for years, with the last big change in 2019, and Baron himself hadn\'t changed in forever. Rift Herald had some core problems around satisfaction and making top lane less enjoyable, so that was another place we looked at.\r\n\r\nGeneral game pacing and predictability were other spots that seemed enticing. We were still early in the process at the time so we had a few more brainstorming sessions and some early paperkitting before getting to work throwing together some messy prototypes to see if there was an interesting direction to go in.\r\nA Game in Three Phases\r\n\r\nThe first iteration we tried was breaking the game up into three distinct phases, initiated by specific triggers: the early game (0-14 minutes or 2 dragons taken) when plates were alive, the mid game (ends when the Horde dies or when Baron spawned at 25 minutes), and the late game.\r\n\r\nThe big question was \"Is it interesting to have a clear delineation between phases of the game, and is it interesting that these change variably? Was it worthwhile to have plates coming and going based on objectives instead of an exact timer?\r\n\r\nThe three phases initially tested okay. The variable transitions themselves were pretty cool, and the phases led to a lot of interesting contextual game states and pretty different games depending on who got ahead and how. However, their trigger conditions needed a lot of work. We also tried out some iterations around an alternate resource system called \"Essence\" or player-driven gamestate swaps, but these didn\'t pan out. We learned that there was a lot of room in the objective flow around Baron pit that could be improved at every point of the game along the way.\r\nEarly Game: So Many Cats\r\n\r\nTo add some variety, we tried out a new style of objective: a cat cult made up of Whisker Little Legends. This was a pile (clowder? cluster? colony?) of cats that spawned in threes every minute, slowly filling up the Baron pit.\r\n\r\n112723_01StandingCats.png\r\n\r\nThe cats didn\'t do much, but we wanted to find out if there was merit to a horde boss instead of a second Herald. Second Herald was always a bit of an odd duck—it can never get tower plates and lanes are mostly done, so it often never gets taken or, when taken, is used so poorly it might as well not have been. It seemed a fruitful spot to change this flow up.\r\n\r\n112723_02CatDance.gif\r\n\r\nWe\'d also never had a horde as an Epic monster, so it was time to test the waters. We needed to answer questions like: What does partial completion mean for an Epic? Was it at all interesting to fight a horde? Do skirmishes make sense when twelve cats are meowing at you violently?\r\n\r\nWe also simultaneously tested roaming manticore creatures (also Little Legends, thank you TFT) that were similar to Scuttle Crab but throughout both jungles. This was to test variable micro-objectives around the map to fight over that added more mid-game objective interest than the standard fights.\r\n\r\nThe manticores were truly awful and quickly removed from testing. Not because the variability was inherently bad, but because there were no animations, their combat was just big thornmail reflect, and because we were asking you to interact with them in the midgame. In the end, we didn\'t think the map could support a set of new objectives scattering the jungle; the complexity ask was very high and the gain did not seem worth it. But this early exploration around alternate map objectives ended up inspiring the changes to Red and Blue buff as mini objectives, as you\'ll see later.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing, we locked in a horde objective. A horde of some sort was worthy of being a new boss in the game, but we still had no clue how the fight would happen or what its payout would be. We had that \"Essence\" system mentioned earlier as a possible outcome, but we didn\'t even know if it would ship so we couldn\'t be tied to that.\r\n\r\nOne iteration of the horde was taking that variable spawn objective and trying to tie it into a weird, cohesive narrative. The Cultist Cats would mine ores in random positions around the map and you could fight them at their mines. If they finished mining, they would teleport to the main cat hive (in Baron pit) and build up their stores, getting more powerful and increasing the reward for taking them out.\r\n\r\nHowever, asking players to regularly detour away from their lanes was awful. Nobody wants to leave at minute six to kick a stupid cat off of a little glowing Ornn pillar for a bit of some resources and lose prio. That part was not working out well at all, so it was quickly yeeted from existence.\r\n\r\nWe did learn that the horde was a lot better as an early objective than a mid-game one. Herald wasn\'t an objective we were happy with either, so it all worked out well. Herald\'s powerful interactions with plates and its tendency to destroy early laning phases being the primary reasons for dissatisfaction (see this blog about map changes). The cats could be a powerful early team objective in ways Herald would never be allowed to be and give top laners real benefits for early leads.\r\n\r\n112723_03ImprisonedHerald.png\r\n\r\nSo we pivoted. Cultists were now a bunch of cats who were absorbing the power of an imprisoned Rift Herald. Killing them would eventually break Herald out. We were also trying to figure out what the fight would be like aside from \"horde.\" At one point, all of the cats empowered one of their brethren to become big and shoot a laser. Or leap at you from a mile away like a Yorick E. We tested a lot of spells for this boss before we locked the final one you see in game: big monsters summoning smaller, decaying ones. (Which are no longer cats, sadly.)\r\n\r\n112723_04Voidgrub.jpg\r\n\r\nThere is no Whisker, only Voidgrub. (And, well, Voidmites.)\r\nMid Game: Mecha Herald\r\n\r\nBut we still had a problem with the mid-game Rift Herald. Luckily, we had an idea that might just work out, but it was kinda crazy. What if you could pilot the Rift Herald? Jump onto that thing and run around crabbed up to the gills.\r\n\r\nIn the first version, whenever you killed Herald and spawned the eye, you could jump into Shelly and essentially play a whole new champ. Your Q was a slow slash (the one she does in fights). Your W was her giant dash. Your E was a shield, and R was jump the hell out of the sinking ship. It was like a tank/siege form that any player could get into.\r\n\r\nSounds awesome right? It was! For a game or two. It quickly became the kind of mechanic a lot of players got frustrated by, not just to play into because it was quite strong, but to play as, because we want to play our champions in League, and not bumbling Void monsters. We iterated a few times, but feedback stayed mixed. So we tested it in a player lab, where the feedback was also mixed at best—so we were back to square one.\r\n\r\n112723_05RiftHerald.png\r\n\r\nWell… not quite. The idea of jumping onto Herald was fun but the gameplay wasn\'t quite right. We threw together a second go at it where it was less about being the Herald and more about controlling the Herald charge. This version was a ton more fun in playtests and for player labs. It had a few problems (like early on you could navigate to escape ganks through the jungle or dodge spells by jumping into it) but it had promise, tuning and polishing came quickly.\r\nLate Game: Baron and His Pit\r\n\r\nWe found that the late-game transition was falling flat, so we experimented with some major map transformations, themed around the Void. Some of these changes were cosmetic, while others affected gameplay. The overarching question was whether we could make the map transform at this point in the game and have it be exciting.\r\n\r\nWe started out by trying the version you see below, but there were giant pillars and walls in the middle of lanes blocking vision and minions and altogether being a giant nuisance. The direction was very cool, but the first version was clearly not.\r\n\r\n112723_06MapWithNewWalls.jpg\r\n	\r\n\r\n112723_07DragonPit.png\r\n\r\nThe next iteration of the Void terrain summoned a map full of Ornn pillars. Every single wall on Summoner\'s Rift was replaced by piles of Ornn pillars—we needed contextually destructible terrain and our current terrain system couldn\'t function that way.\r\n\r\n112723_08OrnnMap.jpg\r\n\r\nWhenever Baron spawned, he fired missiles into random positions in each quadrant, destroying any terrain it passed through. This made each game (and even each Baron spawn) meaningfully affect the map and feel different. The first few playtests of this were incredibly laggy because each missile was a minion with a bunch of buffs running every quarter second. But I digress, this was really quite cool, but it was too random and didn\'t lead to interesting gameplay.\r\n\r\n112723_09BaronMissiles.jpg\r\n\r\nSo we moved on to a much more isolated version of terrain destruction, exclusively around the Baron pit. We created three versions of the pit: Tomb Pit, Wall Pit, and Tube Pit. Each one would happen randomly—we wanted to see if Baron fights having alternate terrain would add interest to the fights game-to-game, and that definitely came through.\r\n\r\nThis was by far the best direction for alternating destructible Baron terrain without a full overhaul of the map. The three different pits had many problems, but their baseline gameplay was super exciting and varied.\r\n\r\n112723_10BaronPit1.jpg\r\n	\r\n\r\n112723_11BaronPit2.jpg\r\n	\r\n\r\n112723_12BaronPit3.jpg\r\n\r\nOur first iterations had major issues around vision lines and walls being invalidated by ADCs and being super side skewed. It was all solvable though. I worked closely with the game analysis team to see if I needed to plop another Ornn pillar down near a wall, or push a wall out a bit, or what have you. We ended up killing the Tomb pit here. It was fairly similar to the base pit, while being less lethal, so it wasn\'t really worth it overall.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was time for us to overhaul Baron himself. This guy was GNARLY back in the day, but since his glow up in 2014 he hasn\'t changed once. So it was time to give him the VGU of a lifetime. Our Art Director Gem \"Lonewingy\" Lim thought he could be a real representation of the Void and a true terror from the Abyss. The goal here was to unsettle and unseat; to make you a little scared of what might come. And generally just to make Baron the coolest Voidborn wyrm ever to wriggle his way into Runeterra.\r\n\r\n112723_13OldBaron.jpeg\r\n\r\n112723_14BaronConceptArt.jpg\r\n\r\nThis was also the time to adjust the fight itself. Each pit has its own Baron with spells tailored for that pit. The long tube pit has lingering rifts that can cut pathways and add danger to entrances. The Wall Pit has a large pull that biases toward its entrances to add danger to what\'s otherwise the easiest to escape. And the base pit, the most claustrophobic, tweaks a spell from Wild Rift\'s Baron that summons Kog\'Maw Rs over everyone\'s head causing a chaotic avoidance party of lightning bolts in a tight pit fight. Baron\'s fight should truly feel distinct game-to-game as the walls shift and the spells blast.\r\n\r\n112723_15BaronRiver.gif\r\n\r\nThat variable objective experimentation from earlier also came back here, in part. We knew we wanted to have minor objectives to fight over for games where there were lull states when Baron and Dragon were dead. When there\'s a few minutes left on each, the game often stalls out.\r\n\r\nRed and Blue Buff ended up being an appealing space to look here. Back in the day, when they were like mini deathcaps and the like, this actually did manifest some for players, but there were some problems with those versions. We wanted to see if we could get similar gameplay around contesting micro-objectives without making them too potent, and also push them into a more team-rewarding direction. Now you have some more tactical decisions around when to get these and how to set up vision before objectives. Pushing enemies off of their Blue Buff before Baron and denying it is a more meaningful action, and should hopefully add a bit more interest to those dead states or set ups.\r\n\r\n112723_16RedBuff.jpg\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a lot of change to how objectives flow in League of Legends, and something we don\'t expect to be perfect right from the start. Hopefully, there aren\'t lane swaps, but we\'ll see. This was an area of the game that\'s been stable, but stale, for a long while now and hopefully, it\'s a lot more exciting to interact with and refreshing to play after these changes.\r\n\r\nLeague of Legends is a game that\'s constantly changing, while at its core remaining exactly League of Legends, so that\'s what we tried to do here. Please give us your feedback and help us keep making this ever-changing game fun for you all. See you on the Rift!\r\nRiot Phlox\r\nGame Designer ? Ezra Lynn'),
('/dev: Season 2024 Map Changes', '2023-11-24', 'map', 'An overview of the next batch of changes coming to Summoner\'s Rift.\r\n\r\nThe League base map hasn\'t changed at all since, what, 2019? And in a bigger way, all the way back in 2014? It\'s a great map, don\'t get me wrong, but it\'s definitely got some problems that have gotten more noticeable as players have learned to play it at a deep and comfortable level. We\'re not here to solve every problem with the map, and we\'re also not here to say we\'re not making new problems for the map (some will certainly crop up!). No map is perfect.\r\nCh-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes\r\n\r\nWe\'ve got a few different goals with the map changes this season. At the highest level, our goal is to make lanes more fair across sides. Red and blue sides have very different advantages in a lane with respect to how to gank them, how fights play out, how you can posture against the brush or river, etc. These differences will still exist, but in lesser ways. For example, top lane red side won\'t feel nearly so exposed when pushing up, so you don\'t need to be a safer laner to exist when the champ select gods put you red side.\r\n\r\nThe second goal of the map changes was specifically around making solo lanes a bit more protected from the junglers, or roamers generally. Ganking as a primary early game output was just too strong in most cases. Each lane had a slightly different reason for their changes however. Let\'s dive into those now.\r\nTop-sy Turvy\r\n\r\nTop lane is in a constant push and pull between players wanting more influence and output over the rest of the map in the lane, and also being substantially less influenced by the other roles, especially early on. For most players, the lane simultaneously feels entirely at the mercy of your jungler (or roaming support in higher skill levels) and also unable to do anything to win the game except with major leads.\r\n\r\nWe\'re substantially reducing the ability for other lanes to affect top in the early game, letting the 1v1 fight really shine. It\'s not like the jungler won\'t be able to gank at all, so still watch out. We\'re also shifting top brush into a pixel in the center of the river so it\'s less side-skewed and substantially more powerful when contested. It tends to be correct to ward outside of the river brush on live in many cases and while this still remains true to an extent, this brush is closer to an optimal warding position and is less potent for ganking than before.\r\n\r\nTop_Lane_View.png\r\n\r\nAlso, an extension of the jungler influence on top lane was early Rift Herald. More often than not, Rift Herald was dropped in top lane (it\'s closest to her lair after all), and she absolutely destroys any laning phase that might exist. What\'s a tower to a crab god? Shelly regularly invalidated laning phases by destroying towers and adding giant influxes of gold to a specific laner, usually entirely at the jungler\'s whim. We\'ve seen that quite often both top laners are dissatisfied with lanes breaking apart this early—the behind player being put into the dumpster, and the ahead player not having any more time to play with their lead. By pushing back Rift Herald, we\'re intending to substantially reduce the volatility of the late laning phase top lane experience. Dovetailing off the objective space, one of our goals with the new Voidgrubs objective is that top laners will have a lot more agency in affecting the outcome of the early top side objective than before. We\'re also making the top side objective more potent for team-wide success than previously so that their early leads can matter more for the team. We\'ll go more into the Voidgrubs in this other article, but overall we\'re aiming to give top laners a lane more protected from outside influence while making their lane more important for the team\'s overall chances of victory.\r\nMaking Mid Less Mid\r\n\r\nMid_Lane_View.png\r\n\r\nMid lane was a similar set of changes for some slightly different goals. It is the lane (on live) with by far the most access for ganking, and one thing we\'ve noticed is that over the years players have learned just how unsafe the lane is for a lot of our more immobile champions without great self-peel. The Zyras and Brands and Karthuses of League have felt like the midlane was no longer able to be their home as more and more high-agency characters appeared and junglers learned just how easy it was to punish these immobile mages.\r\n\r\nOur main goal here was to make mid substantially safer for this class of characters at a fundamental level. Opening up midlane to be mage-forward should give us a real role for this class again. The goal is not at all to push assassins out of this lane, just make it more hospitable for immobile characters with respect to their ability to face junglers. They\'re still definitely gankable, but should be a bit less so than they are currently.\r\n\r\nmid_path_2.png\r\nThe other main change for mid was to open up roam paths that are a little bit safer. Each side will have a path players can roam along that requires putting themselves at substantially less risk to get to river or even the respective lane they\'re roaming to. We\'re pushing out the mid lane brush for the same reasons. Providing mid laners with about 20% more time after seeing an enemy before they can get into actionable range should give substantially less power to early ganks and much more safety to these immobile characters.\r\n\r\nmid_path.png\r\n\r\nMid lane, at its core, is a lane that requires some amount of roaming to support junglers or side lanes. And in the current state of League, the mid laners who don\'t have the agency to safely roam feel invalidated by the role. Altogether our goal here is to lower the requirements to a functional mid laner across champions so that we can support a wider roster of champions there, particularly immobile mages and their like. We are definitely not trying to push champions out of the role though and will definitely be balancing to follow up here, especially since there are surely a number of high-agency mages who will benefit a lot and be overbearing at the start.\r\nRace to the Bottom\r\n\r\nBot lane is getting a smaller set of changes visually, but we definitely still expect them to be quite impactful overall. Just like top lane, we\'re adding parity across sides so that entrances to lane and brush positions are matched roughly equally across sides.\r\n\r\nThese changes open up a new gank pathway through bottom red jungle and are among our riskiest changes to the map. We\'re reducing gank potency elsewhere while nominally increasing it bot lane, so we\'ll be watching this portion of the map very closely to ensure that it\'s still reasonable and enjoyable. Red side bot lane is now particularly more vulnerable than before (as opposed to blue side) because it doesn\'t have the extra distance created from Dragon pit walls to give more time for responding to action on vision or even just to slightly delay movement from river.\r\n\r\nBot_Lane_View.png\r\nThis new gank pathway also doesn\'t allow for as easy contesting of vision in its tri brush because of the relatively easier access from river. It\'s a difficult spot on the map for us to balance and one we\'ll look at closely. The center of river brush should also be more of a focal point to contest as compared to before as it has deeper river control than the old brush and is less side-skewed.\r\n\r\nbot_brush.png\r\n\r\nThis brush should be substantially worse for ganking red-side bot lane when unwarded, however. On live, the river brush gives near unfettered access to lane and this power is brought down to mitigate the concerns around gankability of red-side bot lane. Notably, this brush does cover access to the red tri brush from river to protect your bot lane from all but the deepest wraparound ganks.\r\nJungle Diff(erent)\r\n\r\nFinally, we adjusted the geometry in the jungle to support these lane adjustments and add a lot of new interest to Dragon and Baron fights. Access to these epic monster fights on live is relatively easy through a major choke point opposite the monster, or minor chokepoints deeper into river or the jungle further out.\r\n\r\nBot_River_View.png\r\n\r\nThe latest adjustments aim to shift away from a single choke point and focus combat around multiple entries, as well as generally overhaul how these fights play out as this space is quite solved and players are very used to this macro. Contesting should be a little bit more equal across sides as it currently tends to advantage the team who can comfortably engage and escape from an objective.\r\n\r\nThese adjustments as noted above also do help roaming quite a bit as there\'s a safe secondary path for both teams that doesn\'t involve any jungle movement. All in all, our goal is that junglers should have a harder time ganking, especially early, but shouldn\'t feel like they have no more agency over the game.\r\nOur Method to the Madness\r\n\r\nMap changes can be scary. League of Legends gameplay is quite tightly tuned around the current map in a lot of ways that aren\'t totally obvious. The size of that Aurelion Sol black hole? The range of that Akshan swing? The absolute girth of Cho\'Gath? When you change the map a little bit, all of these things can suddenly get out of whack. There wasn\'t a ton of precedence to look back on. A small mode here, an old iteration there—we were going in a bit more blind than normal, but we knew we wanted to change the map. So we just started tinkering.\r\nearly_river_concept.png\r\nAn early map concept that put Baron and Dragon pits in the river.\r\n\r\nWhat would the game be like if Baron was smack dab in the middle of river? And how about the same with Dragon? Alcoves under towers for dives and sidelane interest? Big river island? There was a pretty big goal for parity here and total overhauls of all major areas in the middle of the map. It was a big dream and honestly one we weren\'t sure we\'d even be able to do.\r\n\r\nBut we took that and started to run with it—digging up some older tools that were a little bit out of date, and doing some very early iterations just to see what would work. We don\'t have infinite resources to build a new map from the ground up, so we needed to focus our efforts. We discarded some of the wilder ideas like mid-river epic monsters and started testing a simplified version which kind of looked like this:\r\n\r\nearly_wall_restructure.png\r\n\r\nThere was easy access into river and alcoves in every lane. Bushes had been nudged around and we started to test on it. This map was… okay. It wasn\'t great, the alcoves were cool but didn\'t get much use. The jungle sections were particularly rough. So many little isolated islands ended up making terrain not feel relevant. They weren\'t blocking pathways meaningfully, so they weren\'t really meaningful at all. And there were some rocks that were kind of heinous with the way they blocked vision, particularly in the alcoves and toplane.\r\n\r\nThis was a period of rapid iteration: get a theory about a rock, throw the changed rock into a playtest, see if it sucked, throw in a new rock. Iteration here, by the way, was taking random rocks from around Summoner\'s Rift, duplicating them, dragging them to form chimeric boulders, and then hoping the artists weren\'t looking at the grotesque mess we were making.\r\n\r\ntop_in-dev_jank.png\r\n\r\nin-dev_mid_jank.png\r\nSome of the aforementioned \"gross mess\" that was in development when changing walls and brush.\r\n\r\nThere were holes in the ground plane, heavy z fighting, piles of frogs in the river, and it was cool! We were getting toward map changes that weren\'t miserable! That\'s always the first step for this kind of change because going from stable and current always leads to some really terrible places at the start.\r\n\r\nWe unified some walls, pushed them back and forth, cut a hole through that honkin\' big rock in mid lane, and so on.\r\n\r\nThen we got to work on the brush more deeply. The value of brush is mostly a product of the value of the walls near them, it controls a lot of fights and vision around terrain and adds a lot of interest. Brush also solves a lot of problems terrain can have on its own. Tackling the minutiae of brush placement and size was a great exercise, but also a minor battle in its own right.\r\nupdated_brush_and_wall_concepts.png\r\nA closer-to-final, top-down map concept with new wall and brush placements.\r\n\r\nBrush can\'t be too far from each other or there\'s too much free space for fog of war to creep in the jungle. They can\'t be too close or they feel worthless and redundant and crowd out fog entirely. They add texture to corners but also make vision around those spots difficult to interact with. They solved a lot of problems around intersections favoring one side or not being interesting to engage in or having sightlines that felt too clean at certain angles. But it also made us play a little jigsaw puzzle, moving around little strands of grass so that Dragon fights still felt meaningful when contested from bot or top river, or blue or red side, or so that we didn\'t have one gigabrush in the ocean map as three different bushes accidentally merged.\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of changes that were actually pretty promising like tower alcoves, or deep water like you see in Arena, or sets of new plants to the base map—but nothing we were quite comfortable with for this set of changes. Maybe someday.\r\n\r\nThe map of Summoner\'s Rift is a space that\'s comfortable, but there are so many cool things we could do with it in the future. We know Summoner\'s Rift is a special place and we take any changes really seriously, so we hope you find that these ones impact your games in a positive way. Let us know what you think and we\'ll see you out there!\r\nRiot Phlox\r\nGame Designer ? Ezra Lynn'),
('/dev: The Voice of the Visionary', '2023-11-22', 'hwei', 'Hi everyone! We\'re the Narrative, Audio, Voiceover (VO) crew who brought Hwei\'s in-game voice to life. We\'re here to provide insight into how a champion gets their vocal identity—from writing, to casting, to recording, and more—with Hwei\'s melancholic musings as our subject.\r\nCraft and Casting: Finding Our Hwei\r\n\r\nIsa Mari \"orkidian\" De Leon, Narrative Writer:\r\n\r\nHello! I\'m Isa, a writer on the Champions team for League of Legends. I wrote Varus\' VO update, Jax\'s VO with his visual update, and of course, Hwei!\r\n\r\nVoice work starts early in a champ\'s development, after determining the broad strokes of their backstory, personality, and goals. I write docs that explore these elements of character and help everyone working on the champ understand what we\'re aiming to create. These materials include:\r\n\r\n    Decks outlining the champ\'s personality, with vocal references from comparable characters. (To summarize Hwei, he\'s a melancholic, emotional, kindly painter. He takes inspiration from morally gray antiheroes and tragic, brooding \"male anime lead #2\" types).\r\n    Deep dives into our own roster, comparing the characterization of existing champs and identifying vocal overlap risks (Hwei\'s tonal overlap risks included Jhin, Viego, Aphelios, and Yone).\r\n    Sample voice lines.\r\n    A casting sheet to be distributed to voiceover talent.\r\n\r\nWith these, we kick off a champ\'s voiceover journey in collaborations between narrative, audio, and VO developers.\r\n\r\nAn in-game example of our collaboration is Hwei\'s linear throughlines. Hwei has a unique series of voice lines that are tied together and progress throughout the course of a single game:\r\n\r\n\"Dark\" Throughline Part 1 - First Move\r\n	\r\n\r\n\"Something dark clings to me—has always lived in me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dark\" Throughline Part 2 - R Rank 1\r\n	\r\n\r\n\"That darkness… takes shape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dark\" Throughline Part 3 - R Rank 2\r\n	\r\n\r\n\"I see. Destruction, and despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Light\" Throughline Part 1 - First Move\r\n	\r\n\r\n\"There is light in me. I can\'t lose sight of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Light\" Throughline Part 2 - R Rank 1\r\n	\r\n\r\n\"My light… grows brighter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Light\" Throughline Part 3 - R Rank 2\r\n	\r\n\r\n\"I understand. Through art, connection.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two routes of thought: a \"dark\" and a \"light\" version, representing Hwei\'s conflicted mind and the emotional journeys he could go through. The lines fire at different points of a game: First Move, ranking your Ult for the first time, then ranking your Ult for the second time. And—fun fact—an addendum is added to each line if Jhin is in the same game as an ally or enemy, reflecting the significant role he plays in Hwei\'s story.\r\n\r\nThis arose after I presented the personality and story of Hwei to his game designer and VO designer. Game design was enthused by the potential to reflect Hwei\'s narrative more closely in-game (shout-out to Myles \"Riot Emizery\" Salholm), and our awesome VO designer Austin \"Riot Puma Pet\" Mullen created the structures to make it happen.\r\n\r\nYou get these throughlines randomly when playing Hwei (you have about a 1/3 chance). Load up a game or several of Hwei and keep an ear out for them!\r\n\r\nNick \"ProfRincewind\" Lanza, VO Producer:\r\n\r\nHi folks! I\'m Nick, the VO Producer for League of Legends. I manage our production timelines for the VO work, help guide the casting and recording process, and keep an eye on the performative quality of the voiceover we create.\r\n\r\nCasting takes place over the course of several weeks (sometimes even a few months) as we send out and collect auditions, review submissions, and work with our team to select the top picks for the role.\r\n\r\nFrom there, we bring selected actors in for callbacks and exploratory recording, where we get them in the room with our director to explore the character, performance, and script—and to see if they are indeed the right fit for our champ!\r\n\r\nWhen it came to finding the right voice for Hwei, we needed to select an actor who could project a vulnerable sadness, but could also swap to a broody intensity—sometimes within the same line. He needed to be somber and reflective, but still energetic enough to stand out amongst all the other sounds happening on the Rift. And on top of all that he needed to be someone players could empathize with to make sure we understand what he\'s been through. We were able to find all of that in the outstanding work of Stephen Fu.'),
('Champion Insights: Hwei', '2023-11-20', 'hwei', 'For many artists and creatives, the need to create surpasses the need for much else. Putting whatever is in your mind on paper or canvas feels essential, like breathing.\r\n\r\nThis is exceedingly true for Hwei, League\'s newest champion, a mid-lane mage who paints the artistic visions that fill his head. But instead of painting on canvas, Hwei\'s works are dynamic, living images that affect anyone who witnesses them.\r\n\r\nWith his paintbrush, Hwei wields destruction or support, controlling the thoughts and emotions of those around him. He may not have a sword or gun, but don\'t underestimate the might of this brooding artist and his brush.\r\nMore Than Meets The Eye\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Hwei is a tale of three pitches: a paint mage, a brooding antihero, and a humanoid male mid laner without purple skin or an exoskeleton. The art mage idea had been brewing for a while, and a number of Rioters contributed to shaping the concept.\r\n\r\n11192023_HWEI23ChampionInsightsArticle_01AnimationStudy.jpg\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the possibility of an artistic mage was on the table, everyone gravitated to it,\" says narrative writer Isa Mari \"orkidian\" De Leon. \"This is an idea that\'s been of interest for a long time, but never yet executed, so I feel really lucky for this to be the first new champion I\'ve contributed to.\"\r\n\r\nThe Champions Team also wanted to end the year on a complex note, introducing a champ with a high skill ceiling.\r\n\r\nBut nailing down a difficult-to-master kit that fit within Hwei\'s art thematic wasn\'t easy. Three game designers had a hand in the process, each building on the last iteration. But something about it wasn\'t quite working. So before the champ concept was put on the shelf in favor of other ideas, the team decided to try an about-face on his gameplay (more on all of this later). As a result, his narrative and art evolved as well.\r\n\r\nHwei\'s visions and magic became more recognizable images and were infused with bright color, clearly communicating his new abilities. Armed with an Ionian paintbrush and a colorful palette, his power is fueled by his own artistic expression.\r\n11192023_HWEI23ChampionInsightsArticle_02_ConceptExploration.jpg\r\nEarly Hwei concepts from artist Nancy \"Sojyoo\" Kim\r\n\r\n\"I\'ve been secretly waiting in the shadows for when we could do an art mage,\" laughs art director Gem \"Lonewingy\" Lim. \"We wanted to do a spell mixer mage, but being an elementalist or a druid had already been done several times, and the art thematic was a unique take for this kind of archetype for gameplay.\"\r\n\r\nHwei\'s inherent power bursts forth when he\'s painting, manifesting in colorful washes of pigment and imagery. His source of power isn\'t his brush, it\'s the artistic ability within.\r\n\r\n\"Hwei\'s not a warrior or a swordsman, so we didn\'t want to treat the brush as if that\'s what\'s elevating him. The power is all internal, and for a mage specifically, I think that that kind of internal inherent power makes more sense,\" says orkidian.\r\n11192023_HWEI23ChampionInsightsArticle_03FinalConcept.jpg\r\nFinal Hwei concept art by Gem \"Lonewingy\" Lim\r\n\r\nHwei\'s outward appearance hints at the creative power churning inside of him. This sad fellow is mostly muted in color, save for his powerful palette… and his eyes which change color based on his mood—a feature he\'s unable to control.\r\n\r\n\"He chronically and magically needs to share how he\'s feeling and what he\'s envisioning. It\'s a thematic link to his source of power, which is the power of expression, and holding nothing back from what\'s inside you,\" says orkidian.\r\n\r\n\"There\'s more than meets the eye for someone like him,\" adds Lonewingy. \"You don\'t know that there are beautiful things happening in his mind and how he sees reality. That\'s impressionism. And how he combines fiction and reality, like realistic experience and also imagination—that\'s surrealism.\"'),
('Quick Gameplay Thoughts: 13.16', '2023-09-13', 'gameplay', 'Quick Gameplay Thoughts: 13.16\r\n\r\nHey everyone, Riot Phroxzon here with a Quick Gameplay Thoughts for patch 13.16.\r\n\r\nThis week I want to talk about three topics that we\'ve been seeing pop up lately: game time and snowballing, champion durability, and role balance (primarily bot, top, and jungle).\r\nGame Time and Snowballing\r\n\r\nOverall, we\'re pretty happy with the current length of games. Right now laning is roughly half of the game while the other half is mid- to late-game, and in games that extend past that we\'re seeing a good amount of back and forth that allows for more gameplay options in the mid- and late-game. In Regular brackets of play, game time is slightly longer than Seasons 9, 2020, and 2021 and slightly shorter than Season 2022. For Elite brackets of play, game time has been stable from Season 9.\r\n\r\nSnowballiness in Regular play is in a healthy spot and still lower than pre-Durability Update levels. In Elite play however, snowballiness has increased a bit due to how the changes to dragons and early sustain in patch 12.14 have been optimized by players over time (which was intended to increase the pace of slower Pro games). Unfortunately the trade off was increased snowballing in Elite play, as they are significantly better at taking objectives and utilizing early game advantages to snowball their leads.\r\n\r\nIdeally, lanes are able to snowball a reasonable amount, such that lane play feels rewarding and gives an advantage going into the midgame, but does not completely decide the game. For example, we think that a Darius that comes out of laning 3 kills and 40 cs up should realistically be able to win a 1v2 due to their earned advantage, but they need to then carry that advantage through repeated success in some broader team to team conflict before winning the game.\r\n\r\nWe\'re not aiming to make significant changes to game time, but are continuing to investigate ways to reduce snowballing in Elite play, while not slowing down the pace in Pro. Things we\'re investigating include lowering the impact of early deaths, adjusting the influence junglers currently have on their games and decreasing the impact of early objective rewards. We\'re still exploring what these changes would look like, but since design changes in this space are challenging and take time to solve we likely won\'t be able to meaningfully address these until after Worlds.\r\n\r\nWhile we acknowledge that not all players are interested in Pro, there is a significant portion of League\'s audience that cares deeply about it, so we\'re trying to find the best compromise between solo queue and Pro as we don\'t want to purely sacrifice one for the benefit of the other. \r\n\r\nDurability\r\n\r\nWe\'ve been seeing discussion about damage returning to the game now that the durability patch is a year behind us. We agree that damage has been slowly creeping back up, but there are a few reasons for this. Item changes from Midseason this year initially resulted in an increase in damage, but after nerfs in the last few patches have been adjusted to be about neutral damage wise with where we were a year ago. There are some specific champions who lost durability from changes to Shieldbow and Bloodthirster and we\'ve been trying to restore that over time (e.g. recent durability increases to Yone and Yasuo). '),
('Quick Gameplay Thoughts: Addressing Mythics', '2023-09-28', 'gameplay', 'Quick Gameplay Thoughts: Addressing Mythics\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the most recent Dev Update, we\'re going to be removing the Mythic item class come Season 2024. But before that happens I wanted to take some time to chat about why we\'re removing Mythics and what that will mean for League.\r\nMythics and Subclass Support\r\n\r\nWhile the Mythic item system works reasonably well for some classes like assassins, for other classes with more divergent needs it\'s been difficult to satisfy all of the users across each of the subclasses.\r\n\r\nAs an example, fighters have many different subclasses (divers, juggernauts, skirmishers, etc.), so trying to fulfill the needs of all those different champions with only four items has proven to be extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nWhile theoretically we could solve the Mythic needs of these champions by creating ~10 Mythics split across each of the subclasses of fighter, every item we add to the Mythic pool adds an additional item\'s worth of complexity to the game. There is a maximum number of items that League can have before it gets too complicated, and for every Mythic item that we add, an item slot is taken up and there is one less in the Legendary item pool.\r\n\r\nGoing into Mythic items, we knew that adding them would mean less itemization options for item slots 2-5. We did increase the total item pool to compensate for this since we knew the Legendary space would be more pinched, but it still wasn\'t enough. We initially thought that the excitement Mythics were bringing as a new tier of items would overcome this, but while ~50% of champions were satisfied with their Mythic items, the other ~50% were left feeling like they didn\'t have items that felt right for them. To fully satisfy the needs of all champions, we would need to add ~30% more items (and the complexity associated with each) to the item system, which we don\'t want to do, as that will make League significantly harder to learn.\r\nMythic Goals and Design Debt\r\n\r\nWhen we started out with Mythic items, they were intended to be high excitement with unique outputs, similar to getting really awesome unique items in MMOs and ARPGs. Dashes (Stridebreaker, Prowlers, Galeforce), big heals, and hard CC were previously few and far between. For example, a Fiddlesticks or Morgana feels like their gameplay gets transformed for the better when they complete Zhonya\'s Hourglass and we were interested in exploring a version of League that had more kit warping effects that augmented champion fantasies for other classes.\r\n\r\nWhile we are able to balance champions around having Mythic outputs (eg. balancing Aphelios around Galeforce), it adds a bit too much design debt when it comes to designing new champions (eg. all ADCs need to be designed around getting a dash from the item system).\r\n\r\nAnother issue with Mythic items is that due to the need to satisfy many different users with a limited number of Mythic items, each item tended to be quite complicated as we often needed to have multiple mechanics or stats on certain items so that they\'d be satisfying across many different champions and classes (many items like Stridebreaker needed 4 stats). Prior to Mythics, items were much simpler across the board which is something we\'d like to get back to.\r\n\r\nThe above issues have led us to the decision to remove Mythic items as a concept and bring those items down to the Legendary tier.'),
